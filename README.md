# Project4
​
Goal: Create a Tableau dashboard where users can filter between songs and display audio clusters related to Acousticness, Liveness, and Tempo 
​
Step 1: Import dependencies and Spotify API Credentials (The user will need to set up a Spotify Developer account and follow the steps on Spotify to obtain a Client ID & Client Secret. Link: https://developer.spotify.com)
​
Step 2: Use the Spotify API to get a token 
​
Step 3: Pull a song id from Spotify 
​
Step 4: Define you your track recommendation and set a limit to pull "X" number of songs
​
Step 5: Get a json response 
​
Step 6: Make an empty list and run a for loop to append the the json text from the above step and pull the name of the some and artist info
​
Step 7: Make a data frame for the track recommendations
​
Step 8: Create a for loop and get the audio features for the songs
​
Step 9: Create a new data frame that contains the audio feautres, song name, and Spotify track id
​
Step 10: Get dummy variables 
​
Step 11: Create a new data frame that contains the song name and Spotify track id
​
Step 12: Using the data frame with audio feautres, song name, and Spotify track id and drop the song name, and Spotify track id because we need a clean data frame for clustering
​
Step 13: Do a KMeans model with a cluster number = 3 
​
Step 14: Fit the KMeans model to the data frame with audio features
​
Step 15: Add the merged_features data frame with the music_cluster you just created with the predict function
​
Step 16: Read in the genre csv file (This file contains a list of 48,000 songs so the songs avaialble are limited)
​
Step 17: Reduce the csv to only Spotify song id and genre
​
Step 18: Combine the merged_features data frame and the reduced csv data frame on the 'id' column and perform a left merge
​
Step 19: Connect to Postgres and create a table with the newly creted data frame 
​
Step 20: Using a Tableau Desktop account connect your to your Postgres database
​
Step 21: Created circle chart (based on clusters), bubble, and bar charts based on song audio features (Acousticness, Liveness, and Tempo)
​
Step 22: Created the dashboard page where end users can filter by song AND/OR the folowing cluster buckets: All, 0, 1, and 2
